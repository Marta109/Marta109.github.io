### 🧠 Memory Game  
**Interactive memory challenge** built with React.  
Choose a theme (animals, flowers, tools, etc.), memorize the position of the pictures in 10 seconds, then guess where they were.
With each round, the number of cards increases (3 → 4 → 5...), but the time stays the same!
🖼️ Images are randomly loaded from an API, and hovering over them shows a description. The game features sound effects.
